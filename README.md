## About Me

Hello! I'm a passionate researcher and developer with a keen interest in **Artificial Intelligence**. My current research focuses on **depth estimation**, a crucial area in computer vision that involves understanding the distance of objects from a viewpoint. This work is at the intersection of AI and robotics, pushing the boundaries of what machines can perceive and understand about the world around them.

## My Vision

I have a deep fascination with the potential of AI, and my ultimate dream is to create an AI system similar to Jarvis from Iron Manâ€”a powerful and intelligent assistant that can understand, learn, and assist in everyday tasks. Imagine a world where AI not only simplifies complex tasks but also anticipates your needs, making life more efficient and enjoyable.

## My Work

- **Depth Estimation**: I'm currently working on projects that involve depth estimation using deep learning techniques. This involves creating models that can accurately determine the distance of objects in an image, which is essential for applications in autonomous driving, robotics, augmented reality, and more.
  
- **AI Enthusiast**: Beyond depth estimation, I'm constantly exploring new areas within AI, from natural language processing to reinforcement learning. I'm always looking for innovative ways to apply AI to solve real-world problems.

## Get in Touch

Feel free to explore my repositories, contribute, or collaborate on projects. I'm always open to new ideas and partnerships. Letâ€™s create the future of AI together!
